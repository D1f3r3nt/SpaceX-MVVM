# SpaceX MVVM

For this project we have used already known techniques such as Xibs for interface design, 
but the main objective of this project was to practice the MVVM architecture.

This iOS application is an application to display information about the missions performed by SpaceX, 
this information is extracted from a SpaceX API. It consists of four screens: A Splash screen, the main mission screen (a listing),
the mission detail screen and from this screen you can navigate to another screen where you can see the information of the rocket that was used.

This application also has mappers and DTO's, for the management of the information and also has a logic to open links in safedrive. 
with a logic to open links in safari, such as now, youtube videos.
